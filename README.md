A mini library to convert your response include header status code to JSON. This actually based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/james2doyle/33794328675a6c88edd6) but I modified parameter position and I want to use it as a library.

## Installation

```
composer require satyakresna/json-response
```

## Usage

Please find the usage on [sample file](/sample.php)
